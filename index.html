        <h3>Studies</h3>
        <p class="small">I studied languages at ITS Pier Paolo Pasolini and then realized that wasn't my path.
        <br>I am now attending my first year at Politecnico di Milano, studying Communication Design.</br></p>
        <br><h3>Passions</h3>
        <p class="small">One of my greatest passions is literature, I'm obsessed with Oscar Wilde and I don't really know if it is wrong or right, the only thing I know is that
        I spent too much money buying his works.
        <br>Maybe I don't have any more money because I buy every little thing that catches my attention and too many Legos. That's my biggest problem.</br>
        In my spare time I usually watch movies and I cry for each, even if it is a comedy.
        Well, I think you got it: I'm weird.</p>
